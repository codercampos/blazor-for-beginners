## Description

This is the base project We are going to use during the entire course. To init your project by your own, you can use the following command:

```
dotnet new blazorwasm -o MyBlazorApp
```

This will create a single page Blazor Web Assembly application.

**Note**
I'm assuming that you have already installed at least .NET SDK 5.0 to be able to create Blazor projects from the command line. If not, please follow the steps in the main readme file in the root of this repo.

If you have installed Visual Studio, You can use the workload installer to enable blazor in your IDE.
